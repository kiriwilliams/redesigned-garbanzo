Upgradeable monster features
## The Nature of Upgrades
Upgrades can have the following effects
- unlock new abilities
- change stats
- purely cosmetic

Effects can have delayed onset, or require specific actions to manifest
- e.g. if you acquire "gourmand" you need to eat X number of different foods to gain a buff?

Upgrades can be of the following types
- Additional body parts
	- visible to the player
	- affect physical abilities in most cases, i.e. boosting physical attack stat, unlocking a new held item slot, unlocking a new attack
- Changes to body parts
	- visible to player
	- can affect physical abilities, i.e. adding item slot, removing item slot, stat changes
	- can affect metaphysical abilities (like special attack in pokemon?), i.e. spell casting, resistance to spells, a luck mechanic?
- Intrinsic changes
	- Do not apply to a specific body part but to the monster as a whole
	- Includes things like changes to skin, color, fur, etc
	- May not have any visible change
		- e.g. "blessed", your monster is protected from critical hits? or "curious", your monster has the chance to choose from an extra option during upgrade (you're shown 4 options instead of 3)

## Standard Body Parts
The majority of tamable monsters are of this type
Either
- body segments are identical and extensible
or
- body segments are added to support specific additional parts and can't support others?
Actually I think it has to be that they are identical and extensible but are added via additional limbs, and cannot be added independently of that?

### Trunk
#### Head
- 1 is included in base monster form
- cannot be removed (unless niche mechanics?)
- all monsters have one (unless niche mechanics)
- can have multiple - max 3? 5?
	- each additional head has the same parts that were the monster's head at start
		- if you started with 2 eyes, a mouth, and 2 ears, each additional head has the same
		- upgrades made to the main head are not copied
	- each head can be a target for upgrades
